## Car Hub Project

- The Car Hub project is a web application developed using Lightning Web Components (LWC) in Salesforce. The application allows users to view and filter a list of cars, and view the details of individual cars. It also allows users to add new cars to the list.

- The application consists of several components, including a car list component, a car details component, a car filter component, and a car form component. These components communicate with each other using message channels and events.

- The project also uses Apex classes to interact with the Salesforce database and retrieve and update car records.

- Overall, the Car Hub project is a good example of how to build a simple web application using Lightning Web Components and Apex classes in Salesforce.
